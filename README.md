# COVID-19 Reports

This project was developed to track numbers about COVID-19 around the world and display it in a friendly way.  
It is possible to see data from infected and recovered people, along with the number of deaths caused by COVID-19.  
Global data is initially shown, but it is possible to select data for each country individually.
